# Tribute to our beloved Pasto Chris Martin (25/08/1941 - 16/08/2016)

What can we say about such a mighty man, great teacher, brilliant motivator a loving and caring Pastor?

Pastor we thank you for your unconditional love, kindness, understanding, encouragement, mentoring, words of wisdom and that great sense of humour.

I know that angels in Heaven are rejoicing. Even as we here must deal with your physical departure from us, we also rejoice knowin you are in that place of Glory with our Load and Savior Jesus Christ. We are enternally gratel to God Almighty that He gave us the opportunity to sit under your preaching and teaching and to enable us to go through this life with the blessed assurance that NOTHING can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord!!!

Thank you for not only being our Pastor, but for geing a friend, and one who walked in humility and persevered through it all. We miss our monthly meetings with you and our conversations during refreshments and the teachings you gave us after some the htose executive engagements. There will never be another like you. God made ONLY one of you. A Divine Inspirational Victoriious Annointed Man of God, both inward and outward. Pastor, you told the congregation a few times that you have no intentions on retiring, that when you retire, it will be when God retires you home. You're now in your new home with a new body. Dressed in your white robe and wearing a well-deserved golden crown.

You lived this life exemplifying what a Godly man is. One who loved the Lord and loved his congregation. One who was concernced about the souls being saved. You lived this life just to live again and I know that God said, "Chris Martin, welcome home, my good and faithrul servant whom I'm well pleased with".

Thank you for being an example of strenght and courage. You kept a sense of humour and positive outlook during the tough times, never letting health, society or circumstances keep you from working towards and reaching your goals. The life lessons you taught us have been valuable and will always be close to our hearts. Thank you for loving us, supporting us and being a Pastor to us.

A humble servant, you often taught us how to be practical. You hardly instructed because you lived by example and was never afraid to use your hands to get the work done. So, as we bid farewall, it's with dignity, pride and hope that Pastor Martin leaves a legacy of hope, strong leaders and an exemplary life so that we can say, as writting in Ezra 5:8 - New International Version (NIV)- **"The work is being carried on with dillegence and is making rapid progress under their direction ."**

Some people come into our lives and quickly go. Some people move our souls to dance. They awaken us to a new understanding with the passing whisper of their wisdom. Some people make the sky more beautiful to gaze upon. They stay in our lives for a while, leave footprints on our hearts, and we are never, ever the same.

**Pastor Chris Martin served his community with dignity and humility, sincerity and compassion.**
**"In the infamous words of beloved Pastor - To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord"**

There are no words to describe how much we will miss you Pastor.

Love always - Paseo Executive Committee
